## This function is called when the animation_finished signal is emitted.
## This will transition from player from the jump fall transition animation to the fall animation

## This function is called every frame and is used to player the footstep sound effect

## This function is called when the animation_change signal is emmited.
## It is used to swap from jump to jump_fall transition when going from jump to fall
## This also plays the sound effects for jumping and landing
